This program utilizes Maven, Servlets, JSP, and TomCat to provide a user with a background in 
single malt whiskey flavors, then prompts the user to specify which flavors sound more
appealing.  The program takes those answers into account in the form strings then parses
them to integers 0-3, where they are inserted into an array of an array as what are 
essentially the row and column locations of a two dimensional array.  Strings of whiskeys
that match the location of user input (flavor1 and flavor2) are stored in the arrays and
then output to the user as a suggestion for purchase.  The whiskey flavor information list
of whiskeys were borrowed from http://drinkwire.liquor.com/post/single-malt-whisky-guide-infographic#gs.84arC7k.
All credit goes to the original author Alexander A. Woldehanna (aka Intoxicology). I 
learned a lot from this information and hope the user will also.
